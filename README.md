#Release Notes

This is the initial release of the app ChoreMate
Features include:
- Editable Chore List
- Calendar
- Reminders
- User Data 
- 
Known bugs:
- No known bugs

Missing functionality:
- Chores have no repeating functionality (this functionality proved to be complex as we needed to keep track of time, we prioritized other functionality that we decided was more important to the initial release of our app)
- Initially, our goal was to implement push notifications. We could not figure out a way to implement these as we are not licensed apple developers, thus we regrouped and implemented internal reminders instead. The functionality exists, it is just different than our initial plan
